# OS & Architectures labs demo
This repo contains a rewritten version of the CSC398/CSCM98 lab tasks for the `gcc` compiler. These are not the real lab tasks for this module, although the content is similar. This is purely for aiding your understanding of the lab work, C++, and multiprocessing.

## Content
- [Lab 1](./lab1) looks at getting C++ setup on your computer, and introduces you to what multithreading in C++ looks like.
- [Lab 2](./lab2) is about race conditions and how to share data properly when working with concurrency.
- [Lab 3](./lab3) is about applying our knowledge so far to fix an example money-passing game.
- ~~[Lab 4](./lab4) is not yet implemented.~~
- [Lab 5](./lab5) is about using processor-level SIMD instructions to improve performance.

## Setup
### On your own computer
1. [Download](https://github.com/mhmatthall/cscm98/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) or `git clone` this repo
2. [Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and install Visual Studio Code (vscode) if you haven't already
3. Follow [the instructions in lab 1](./lab1/readme.md) for getting everything set up on your computer

### On the lab computers
The setup __will not work__ on the University lab computers (yet), but will work on the [online `gcc` compiler](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c_compiler). Make sure you set the language to `C++ 17`.
