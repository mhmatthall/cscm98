# OS & Architectures labs demo
This repo contains a rewritten version of the CSCM98 lab tasks that are more versatile - not requiring Windows or the `msvc` compiler. These are not the real lab tasks for this module, although the content is similar. They are purely for aiding your understanding of the lab work, C++, and multiprocessing.

## Setup
Lab 1 goes through how to install and setup Visual Studio Code on your computer and configure it for C++. It shows you how to use the included build and debug scripts, and then gives a simple introduction to C++ and its multithreading capabilities.

The setup __will not work__ on the University lab computers (yet), but will work on the [online `gcc` compiler](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c_compiler). Make sure you set the language to `C++ 17`.
